This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to Firebase data persistence inconsistencies. The bug showcases a scenario where data fails to persist reliably across sessions, especially when offline capabilities are engaged. The solution illustrates how to correctly implement persistence and handle potential conflicts to ensure data synchronization works as expected.  The primary issue is related to how data updates are handled when the application comes back online after being offline.  This example uses JavaScript.
